# 🌸 Anime Recommendations Website

Hey there, fellow anime fan! 👋  
This is a simple yet beautiful **Anime Recommendation Website** I built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It’s designed to help you discover amazing anime shows — whether you’re in the mood for action, drama, or something that’ll make you cry (yep, I see you, *Your Lie in April* fans 🥲).

## 🎯 What This Site Does

The website shows a collection of hand-picked anime recommendations with:
- Cover images and short descriptions  
- Genre tags (like Action, Romance, Sci-Fi, etc.)  
- Ratings and number of episodes  
- Links to where you can watch or learn more  

It also has a clean dark theme with soft glowing cards — perfect for anime vibes at night 🌙.

## 🧱 What I Used

- **HTML5** → For structure and content  
- **CSS3** → For styling, animations, and layout  
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** → For a modern, readable font  
- **Flexbox & Grid** → To make everything responsive and neatly arranged  

No frameworks. Just clean, simple code ❤️

## 💻 How It Looks

The page has:
- A **header** with a glowing logo and navigation links  
- A **search section** to find animes by title or mood  
- A **grid of anime cards** with images, ratings, and genres  
- A **footer** made for anime lovers ❤️  

Everything scales nicely on phones and tablets too — so you can browse comfortably from anywhere.
